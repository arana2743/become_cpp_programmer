# become cpp programmer

### Learning basics of C++ programming language as part of roadmap to become C++ programmer

### 1. Datatypes in C++
1.1. Primitive or fundamental
  - Integer
    - storage: 4 bytes
    - range: (-2 raise to power of 31) to (2 raise to power of 31 - 1)
  - Floating-point
    - storage: 4 bytes
    - range: ±3.40  x (10 raise to power of ±38)
    - A float can store seven digits after a decimal point precisely
    - we can also store number in scientific notation as well example: 97e4 i.e. 970000
  - Double
    - storage: 8 bytes
    - range: ±1.79  x (10 raise to power of ±308)
    - A double can store 15 digits after a decimal point precisely
  - Void
    - A void data type represents an entity without a value.
  - Character
    - storage: 1 byte
    - range: (-2 raise to power of 7) to (2 raise to power of 7 -1)
    - character value is always written in single quotes
  - Boolean
    - storage: 1 byte

1.2. Derived 
- Functions
- Arrays
- Pointers
- Reference

1.3. User defined
  - Structure
  - Union
  - Enum
  - Class
  - Typedef
